\title{Run Parallel Replications with Optional Parallel Processing}
\usage{
run_replications(
  conditions,
  n_replications = 100,
  parallel = TRUE,
  num_cores = detectCores() - 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conditions}{A data frame containing the grid of conditions with \code{n_students} and \code{n_items}.}

\item{n_replications}{Number of replications to run for each condition.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If TRUE, runs simulations in parallel.}

\item{num_cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to all available cores minus one.}
}
\value{
A list of results, including theta, item, and correlation summaries for all conditions.
}
\description{
This function runs multiple replications of a simulation for all conditions,
with an option to use parallel processing.
}
\examples{
conditions <- expand.grid(n_students = c(500, 1000), n_items = c(12, 24))
results <- run_replications(conditions, n_replications = 100, parallel = TRUE)
}
